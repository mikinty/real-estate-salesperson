# Becoming a Licensed Real Estate Salesperson

One of the first steps to working in the Real Estate industry is to become a licensed Real Estate Salesperson. Without this license, you are not allowed to sell property or help people buy property.

While there are many guides on this process, and an official state website for this, the steps are not always clear, and actionable items are not always clear. This guide is meant as a journal but also as a tutorial for others who are looking to get into real estate and don't have a mentor to help them with the process.

## The Steps

Let's go over what you have to do step by step to become a licensed real estate salesperson.

### Requirements

I think [PrepAgent provides a great explanation here](https://www.prepagent.com/real-estate-exam-by-state/NY/new-york-real-estate-license)

For NY specifically, I also needed to get a NY ID, which was a curveball since I'm out of state.

### Register and complete an approved 75-hour real estate course for your state.

There are many options here, and many of them are good. 

  - For me, I was just self-studying, so I just needed a textbook essentially. [Real Estate Express](https://www.talkable.com/x/yn6IDa) provided me with an affordable option, costing around $180 for the course, so I was very happy with that. I do have to say their UI isn't super up-to-date, but it works and is very straightforward. Also quizzes at the end of each chapter was very helpful.
  - I think [PrepAgent](https://www.prepagent.com/sign-up) is a great option here, as they have great videos online on Youtube, have modern UI, and seem to have a good support.

The way the course works is that there are a bunch of chapters, covering both National and State Real Estate content. For NY, each chapter has a minimum amount of time you have to spend in the chapter, so if you finish early, you will have to wait around a bit. However, if you pay attention and study the chapter at a reasonable pace, you probably won't have much time to spare anyway.

At the end of the course, after you have completed all the chapters and completed the quizzes, you will be able to schedule and take the final exam. I thought this was the officia Real Estate Exam, but I was a bit disappointed when I learned I still had to take another exam (more about that later...), but hey, that's why I'm writing this guide.

Once you pass the course exam, you have completed the course officially, which means the 75-hour course requirement is done. 

After the exam, you still have to submit an affidavit of course completion to the course provider, who will then send you a certificate that you will need to use for getting your license.

### Taking the State Exam

Apparently, most courses are harder than the state exam so they prepare you better. It's a bummer that you have to take yet another exam even after you've already worked so hard to pass a course, but I guess that's just how it be.

For NY, you sign up for your exam by

- Going to the [NY Department of State Website that covers the Real Estate Salesperson](https://dos.ny.gov/real-estate-salesperson)
- You will then [sign up for the written exam here](https://appext20.dos.ny.gov/nydos/registration.do?from=loginPage). Notice that you do need your NYS ID, so if you don't have that now, you should definitely get one!

### Find a Sponsoring Broker

You can actually do this before you finish the course, but I think it helps to know more about the field before doing this. Maybe consider this step when you're 75% the way through your studies.

Finding a Broker is very open to your desires. If you do full time, there are likely more brokers that will take you.
