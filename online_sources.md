# Online Real Estate

As with most things these days, the Internet is the easiest and most efficient way to look for listings, both rentals and sales.

Here we review some of the most common ways to find listings, some thoughts about them, and pitfalls to watch out for.

## [OLR](https://broker.olr.com/)

The official source of listings for Brokers, by Brokers.

As brokers, we are supposed to use OLR to list everything. But because the platform has such crappy UI and is relatively difficult to use, it's not that great for rentals. For sales, it's a bit better, but other platforms like [StreetEasy](#streeteasy) are much more popular by customer traffic, and therefore are updated by brokers more often.

## [StreetEasy](https://streeteasy.com/)

Popular to the common masses, and therefore, also common to agents for the attention it gets, StreetEasy is the standard of modern online real estate. It has an easy to use search interface, pictures are easy to look at, and it's very easy to contact agents. Floor plans, videos and 3D tours are attached to listings, amenities are listed, and map locations along with public transit access are available.

The search tools aren't amazing, but generally are good enough for the consumer. This is usually to the fault of the listing agent, who doesn't put all the relevant details of the listing. This also means that listing quality is also up to how much effort the agent puts into it. One red flag I've found is that if a listing has very few photos, with extensive virtual staging, and no public video or floor plan, it's likely that there is some sort of coverup happening to prevent you from seeing something. Their goal is to get you to go in person and then consider it a bit more. I despise this practice and wish agents were more honest about their listings and prevented people from making disappointing trips.

There are scammers on the site, which is unfortunate since StreetEasy can guard against it with more rigorous agent verification. A common example of a scam is if an agent says to "directly Zelle them the money to 'secure' the listing before it is gone." Don't fall for this, and never send money to anyone until you have signed a lease, seen the place in person, and met the agent that is listing the property.

## [Craigslist](https://newyork.craigslist.org/search/apa)

A great place to find too-good-to-be-true prices, and also a great place to get scammed.

Some ways to make sure that you're looking at a legit listing, here are some things you can do

- Look for cross-listings. If the listing is on another site that's more reliable, that's a good sign.
- Even though people will claim to be licensed independent brokers, that is often not the case. Having a zoom call with headshot is a good way to confirm. Obviously this is not enough alone.
- Never send ANY money to the agent until you've verified that the listing is legit
- A huge red flag is if they tell you the listing is hot and you have to sign without being about to see it. If they say that there are "privacy concerns" with existing tenants, which is why they aren't doing showings. That's total BS because every future tenant should have the right to see the place in person that they are about to live in for 12 months+
- If you cannot visit the place in person, request for a virtual, live tour of the place.
- It's good to have an agent help you get a deal here, since scammers will likely not hold up well to agents.

## Facebook Groups

This is like Craigslist, but a bit less scammy, since you usually have a face attached to listings at least. As the same as Craigslist, you should definitely verify that the listing you have is legit.

I've found that agents have polluted Facebook groups, so you might just be getting a barrage of listings that agents are trying to get rid of, instead of the organic local community that you may be hoping for.

As a side note, there are Facebook groups where there are people giving away furniture or items they don't need when they move out. These groups are often prefixed with "Buy nothing..." Highly recommend if you are willing to snag up some used furniture and save some money.

## [Leasebreak](https://www.leasebreak.com/)

Place to find leases that people are giving up on. The market is not very liquid here, so you may find really good lease breaks, and on the other hand you often find a lot of overpriced listings. Most of the leases are sublets as part of a larger lease, like a one bed out of three. I've found that certain agents have polluted this site with their listings, and the site may be better off without agent listings.

## [transparentcity](https://www.transparentcity.co/)

Claims to link you directly to property managers and cut the middleman out of the transaction.

I've found apartment prices to be quite expensive here, and the UI doesn't seem too fluid, as the site mostly just directs you to contact the apartment manager on their website.

## [Sonder](https://www.sonder.com/)

Good for day-by-day living while you figure out what you want to do. It's a great alternative to a hotel, if you want some more amenities, like a communal space or a real kitchen. These are often quite pricey, but they are large and good for their purpose, which commands their pricing.

## Co-Living

Co-living is basically subletting part of an apartment that already has tenants. The idea is that this allows for more flexibility of leases, since for example in a 4 bedroom, all 4 people don't have to have the same lease, and instead they can all shuffle at 4 independent paces.

The downside of co-living is that you have to share the common spaces with often strangers, and if the original leaser messes up the leasing of the apartment (e.g. they aren't allowed to do it but they do it anyway), you might find yourself kicked out and homeless very quickly.

## Finding Roommates

Generally, finding roommates through friends is a better bet than random people, _but_ if you are out of ideas or sources, you can try online sources.

I have seen in the real estate circle that [EXR COnnect](https://www.exrny.com/connect) has been recommended to clients, although I'm not sure how well it works...so beware that yonder may contain dragons.
