# How to Buy a Mansion

Taking notes from Arvin Haddad and my own experiences.

There are broadly a few categories of mansions. Penthouses in tall buildings in NYC, townhouses in cities, and single family homes (think Bel-Air). 
Not all of the topics apply to every category, e.g. approach doesn't really exist for penthouses or townhouses. 

Originally, I was going to create the "perfect mansion," but that is not really possible because of variety and tastes. But there are ways to perfect each category.

## Privacy

Rich people especially, need privacy to live their lives. 

- You cannot have other houses looking into you
  - Helps to be higher up
  - Helps to have wall or hedging

## Approach

You need anticipation when driving up to the property. This is usually some sort of winding road, or, a road that approaches the property and has foliage that wraps the view and slowly reveals the property. The view of the property has to be impressive, so you don't want to see a bad side of the house or see a guest house as the first thing.

This also means for guests, when they enter your house, they need to experience this approach as well. So if it's not impressive, then your guest will be disappointed as well.

It is good for staff to enter from a different location.

## Wow factor

When you enter the house, you can have a foyer, but the first real room you go to must have some sort of "wow." This can come from volume (width and height), views, decor, etc. Usually volume and views are the wow factor. You want to enter from the center, not from the side.

View: do you get to see landmarks, are neighbors obstructing your view.

## Kitchen

Heart of the house. People want to hang out here.

- 48 inch wide gas range with strong vent to be able to make steak
- Island + bar seating
- 2 Ovens
- 2 Dishwashers
- 2 Sinks
- Large wine fridge
- Seating area / Breakfast nook

Pot filler is usually not something you want actually. Can break easily, e.g. faucet failure and leaks, and gets dirty.

A very large house should have a Chef's Kitchen, for the staff. This kitchen should be very functional, so it has to be large enough to provide food for the number of guests that would be at the house.

## Primary Suite

- Sitting area: Ideally a separate room from the primary residence
- Should not be too big, or else doesn't feel cozy.

Bathroom
- Water closets should be partitioned off
- Shower should be able to fit 2 people comfortably, and have water that reaches all of the shower

Closets
- His: Doesn't have to be super big, men are simple
- Hers: Needs to be significantly larger. Ideally has shoe area, winter clothes, normal clothes, island, jewelry cabinets. Glam room for makeup and hair room would be extra. 3-way mirrors and lots of mirrors to get views is great.

## Landing area

This is the area right when you walk up a stairs. Ideally it is large enough for a seating area, and has views of outdoor space.

## Pool

- Ideally 75' for laps, also need to have walls on both sides or else you can't do laps. So you want to have stairs that don't interfere with laps.
- If you can, a hot and cold plunge
- Sauna if you can 
- Location inside unless weather is good, then outside is fine
  - If inside, needs to be in an inspiring location, aka not in a dungeon

## Wine Cellar

It needs to have mood lighting. It needs to be humidity and temperature controlled. 

Shelving should hold not only normal sized bottles, but larger format ones as well. Also cases.

Needs to be resistant against earthquakes.

Needs to have space to decant wine.

You want to be able to drink your wine in your cellar as well.

## Purpose

Having too many sitting areas is useless. 

Other purposes:

- Bars
  - A good bar should look fun, have some sort of lighting
  - You don't want too many bars in the house
- Game room
  - Pool or ping pong table
- Movie Theater
  - A bar inside the movie theater, popcorn maker
Gym
  - A good gym needs to be inspiring to work out in. You don't want a gym that is crammed into a dungeon

## Layout

- Super long houses is not good
- Lots of hallways is wasted space
- If you have a guest house, it should be separate from your living areas. Either a different floor or a different section

## Aesthetics

- Not too noisy: especially marble patterns
- If it's too plain: minimalism usually works in small places but not big spaces
- "Boring" decor: If you have a lot of white wall space
- Darker finishes are riskier. Kitchen and bathroom should have light finishes.
- Darker finishes are usualy masculine
- You usually want 2 types of finishes at most in a room. If you have 3 or more, it gets too loud.
- Backlit onyx or stone can be tacky if used excessively

## Target buyer

Bachelor vs. family

If the property is marketed too much towards one audience, it will be hard to sell.

For families, kid safety is very important. Having places where kids can climb, fall, drown (water), are not desirable.

## Extras

- Styles of houses: French Normandy, Spanish, Italian, Mediterranean.
