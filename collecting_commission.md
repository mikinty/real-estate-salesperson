# My Commission Policy

So as a background, I don't work in real estate full-time, which means I can't dedicate my entire day to finding properties for clients. However, I will provide a service that I think is worth it to both my client and me. Being a very realistic and honest person, with tech skills, I provide professional, punctual and well-researched opinions, with a variety of flexible commission schedules for tiers of services that my clients can choose from; anywhere from commission-free all the way to more case-by-case commission.

I work with a lot of friends, so I don't like charging for commission if I don't have to. This is not to say my friends can just order me around and ask me to do a ton of work without compensation; I will make sure whatever I do is worth it for me and my client.

Generally, my friends / clients are willing to do some work themselves, searching on StreetEasy. Therefore, my policy is:

- I have a list of properties that I have self-vetted through previous experience. I am happy to send these to you for consideration. If they offer a Broker OP, that is, I get paid by the building, I will take you there. **You don't have to pay in this case because the building will pay me**.
- If you find a listing yourself, I would prefer if you visit it. This is because there are lots of bad listings online, and probably 95% of the time, the listing was not worth seeing in the first place. There are a variety of reasons for this, e.g. virtual staging, photo manipulation, misleading photos, bad property, unseen factors, etc. Bottom line is the risk is too high that I'd prefer if you see it. **No charge in this case since you are touring the property yourself**.
- If you must have me visit the building for you, or with you, I'd like to be compensated for it. Please contact me for more details about how this works, but **commission is case by case basis**.

## Why I collect commission

Fundamentally, you're collecting commission because you are providing someone with value that they otherwise wouldn't be able to get without you.

### Services I can Provide

- **Asking me to visit properties for them**: This is usually something that out-of-state clients ask from me.
- **Asking for a large search that takes more than a few hours for me to do**: I am searching and working hard to curate a high-quality list of options for you.
- **Scam Prevention**: While normal people often can get scammed, having an agent represent you or just show up will usually have the scammers stay away. This is especially true on sites like Craigslist, where scammers will not bother responding to an agent email, because they know they can't scam them.

## Some Notes

- **Buildings that offer OP**: You usually only find this in luxury buildings. Sometimes management companies offer this as well.
