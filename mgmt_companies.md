# Management Companies

There are certain management companies in NYC that have a special way of doing real estate deals. Here we describe some of them and point out how the process works, and things to watch out for.

## [Centennial Properties](https://www.centpropny.com/)

Centennial is a property management companies that buys buildings, usually on the older side, renovates them, and then rents them out. 
I believe they have in-house brokers, but for outside brokers (most of us), the way this deal works is 

1. You find a listing that your client might like from Centennial
2. You go to the office (740 Broadway in NYC), and pick up the keys
    - Notice that in order to pick up keys, you have to put a $20 security deposit, your business card, and show an ID for proof. If you do NOT return the key in 24 hrs, there is no leeway and you WILL lose your deposit. Therefore, I advise that you set a reminder everytime you check out keys so you remember to return them. Alternatively, if you can't make it, you can ask for extensions, but this isn't always possible since the receptionist doesn't pick up the phone all the time.
3. You go to the property. The way the keys work is usually the key is for the front door, and the property that you are seeing has the lock removed, so you can just go in.
4. If your client likes the property and they sign, you will get 1 month broker OP (normally)

The application can be done entirely online now, which is nice.

In terms of what the properties are like from Centennial, they are on the shabby to mid-tier level for NYC. 
- Pricing wise, you can get around 1.5-2k a month per person for 2 or 3 beds, so it's pretty worth it in that aspect. 
- Most buildings are small, in terms of width and height, so you're not going to get natural lighting for the most part.
- Rooms are generally pretty small, and some places have been flexed to make it satsify a 2 or 3 bed constraint. Expect 9x10 bedrooms.
- Appliances are pretty low-tier, and you might get half size dishwashers. Don't expect a kitchen food disposal in the sink.
- Bathrooms are actually decently nice in the renovated listings.
- If there's a washer dryer in a renovated listing in-unit, it's going to be a new one.
- In the renovated buuildings, floors are ok, and the lobby is generally much nicer than before.

So for the final verdict, I would say if you're on a budget, Centennial has some good offers for both the client and the broker. The broker will most likely not charge the client as they are already being paid by Centennial, and the client gets a decent listing (if it's renovated), for the price.
