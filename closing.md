# How to close deals

The most exciting part of real estate besides touring beautiful properties is collecting the commission for your hard earned work. 

## Rentals

1. At the first substantial contact with your client, you should have them sign 
    - Fair Housing Act
    - Tenant Disclosure Form
2. When you have a deal for your client, make sure to obtain a copy of the lease
3. Submit an invoice to your client
4. Submit a CMS entry for your deal. For example, my firm uses [Builder CMS](https://www.buildercms.com/cms/login.aspx)
    - This will likely require you to submit some details about your deal, along with the documents collected in 1. and 2.

Congrats, enjoy your fresh bread!

## Sales

These are way more complicated, TBD.
