# How to close deals

The most exciting part of real estate besides touring beautiful properties is collecting the commission for your hard earned work. 

## Rentals

1. At the first substantial contact with your client, you should have them sign 
    - Fair Housing Act
    - Tenant Disclosure Form
2. When your client is about to sign a lease, you usually need to collect the following from them. These documents are used to qualify the potential resident.
    - Photo ID (if your client is not a US citizen, you may have to collect their social security number card as well)
    - Last 2 paystubs
    - Last 2 bank statements
    - Letter of employment with salary, plus any other supporting documents for salary
    - Tax returns (I don't think this is as needed anymore these days)
    - Recommendation letter (mostly condos and coops) 
4. When you have a deal for your client, make sure to obtain a copy of the lease. This should be the FULL lease with all the agreements to amenities, quiet hours and all the knick-knacks. It should be pretty long. Why do we need this? IMO it's just a legal formality and pretty useless, but I don't make the law.
5. Submit an invoice to your client
6. Submit a CMS entry for your deal. For example, my firm uses [Builder CMS](https://www.buildercms.com/cms/login.aspx)
    - This will likely require you to submit some details about your deal, along with the documents collected in 1. and 2.

Congrats, enjoy your fresh bread!

These are way more complicated, TBD.
