# Advice for Renting in NYC

## Judging an area

- Don't fall too much in love with living _in_ the area you want to hang out in most. You should live _convenient and close enough_ to that area as a good compromise. After all, who wants to have club music blasting under their apartment all the time?
  - What this means is that you should value **subways** at an absolute. They are the single-most important transportation mechanism in the city.

## Neighborhoods

Agents aren't legally allowed to make judgments about the demographic of an area, so they leave it to the clients to judge for themselves. That being said, here are some general descriptions of neighborhoods around NYC:

- FiDi: More family-like and quiet
- LES/EV: Bustling with activity, lots of small shops, food places, and bars
- West Village / Chelsea: Classy Manhattan with Italian restaurants and dimly lit candles.
- Hudson Yards: More industrial. Kinda dead rn until further development happens, but a haven for the more wealthy for the most part.
- Midtown: Classy in some places (Billionaire's Row, Columbus Circle, Central Park border), but bustling and touristy in others (Times Square). This is the intersection of everyone in Manhattan, so things tend to be more busy here.
- Hell's Kitchen: Less developed area of the city with the occasional new shiny skyscraper. Lots of budget options here.
- Kips Bay / Murray Hill: More quiet, but has good budget apartments so lots of young people go there.
- Upper West Side/Upper East Side: More class
- Long Island City: Super new area with lots of apartment buildings, but restaurants and shops are on the rise. Good budget option.
